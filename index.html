Yasu/G’day/Hello Everyone!

                <h3 class="text-center">Intrest in IT:</h3>
                <p>Interest in IT:
My interest in IT has always been programming and the amazing things computers can achieve. It's a bit of a stock standard for an IT student but I really have an interest in the workplace of IT and what teams of people lead by their passion and drive for a project can achieve. My interest in IT started when I was young, using minecraft’s commands and notepad’s html uses to create cool things. I have completed both VCE IT subjects in Data Analytics and Software Development, they were both great subjects to get a head start into the IT world. I don’t have much work experience in IT but plenty of personal experience.
I chose to study at RMIT because I mean it has ‘IT’ in its name. I thoroughly went through other universities' IT courses and RMIT’s was clearly the best choice. The campus for RMIT is really unique as well, I’ve always loved the city and to study here is amazing. 
I’m hoping to learn more about programming and coding solutions, the practices, workplace standards and techniques used by companies to solve problems and create applications. I also hope to learn more about the general IT industry and I hope to have a knowledge of a lot of the current big industries in technology. As for the content that is in the Bachelor of IT, I’d wish to learn that which employers expect an IT worker to understand and be knowledgeable about.

IT Manager Job in Melbourne - SEEK
The position is an IT manager, which means that if I were able to work in this position, I would be heavily involved in both a technical and leadership role, both of which I have experience and high interest in.It would be really amazing to lead a group of people as well as the company systems to achieve tasks effectively. The position itself does require at least 5 years of experience in an IT manager role, meaning I would have to apply for a standard IT job and work my way through another company's ranks to earn some sort of manager/leadership position. The skills required would include hands on work in various different IT areas, the job would also require me to lead other colleagues in these areas. I have worked over a number of years taking on different leadership positions as well as taking on as much IT related work as possible for a student. My plan of obtaining this job would be to first find a similar IT company, perhaps a much smaller workspace and use the experience and data (work performance related statistics) I obtain from working there as a reference/ proof of employment.

                <h2>Personal Profile</h2>
                <h3>Results of personality tests</h3>
                <p>
Campaigner, ENFP-A
The campaigner is a leader type personality that is based upon independence and being free, Campaigners are often intuitive and are known as ‘masters of people’. Their traits include being observant, enthusiastic, excellent communicators, and being very friendly. They exceed in starting practical tasks and conveying ideas. However they lack organization and tracking tasks and get stressed easily. I think this is fairly accurate and it means that I would do better in a manager position of people rather than something like a systems admin, who needs to not crack so easily under pressure and work almost strictly with computers. I think the results of this test line up well with my career choice as all of the traits are very necessary to operating a group of people and an IT system. This therefore means that when completing tasks in groups or working in any IT field that I would be better of in a leadership role, it also means that the more communication I have with my colleagues and the more opportunities I have to work with them the better. This test result means I would also be a great team player and would put myself in positions where I work with others. It may also mean that I get competitive for leadership roles which may cause conflict.
What's Your Learning Style? The Results (educationplanner.org)
The results of this test state that I am an auditory learner; 40%, and Visual 30% and Tactile 30%. This would Be accurate and correspond well with my career choice as I audibly learn from my workmates and would also require my own personal time to complete repetitive tasks in a quiet space as I would be easily distracted by noise. This test shows that in terms of team work, I would be a great manager because I would be very attentive to what other employees have to say. This would also make sense as I am currently working as a swimming teacher, meaning my paid job is in a very loud environment where I have to listen attentively to questions whilst giving instructions. 
My results from the BigFive personality test - Big Five (bigfive-test.com)
The results from this test show that my personality is very trustworthy and highly communicative, the same meaning applies to these results, that the career choice I have selected lines up with my personality.

                    <h2 class="text-center">Project idea</h2>
               <p>Project idea: 
My project idea is a simple one: make an automatic puppy feeder! Yes plenty of them exist but I want one built especially for my house, one that is not similar to Doc Brown’s can opener in “Back to the future”, one that instead has food stored in it, and is set to a timer, so all the machine has to do is turn a motor, releasing the food onto a set location. 
Motivation
My motivation is that I own a puppy myself, her eating habits are poor and all over the place. She often doesn't eat enough because there is no one there to give it to her, and she sometimes eats too much. Having the automatic food dispenser would solve both of these problems. Automation of physical tasks especially with pets has been on the rise in recent years, so it would be a great opportunity to work on something like this.
Description
The automatic dog feeder itself would be a small device that could be placed anywhere in the house, its portability would mean the use of the machine could be anywhere within a house or outside. The machine would be made from a raspberry pi, a motor, and the appropriate plastic models, including a scoop/storage unit holding food, that would be flipped over by the motor, and the motor would be activated by the raspberry pi, timed every so many hours. The size of the machine would not have to be big at all, in fact should only be able to serve on cup of dog food, meaning that the motor should only be able to spin about 300 grams (serving cup included) which means the motor(s) will only need to produce 3 newtons of force. The raspberry pi program would be easy to make from scratch but could also be copied online, all it would require is a timer that is to be activated once turned on, and a certain voltage administered to the motor once the timer ends. The effect would be a controlled and timed diet for a puppy, meaning the product could be used when owners are either home, or away. An important note is that the product should not supplement human nourishment and a full eating plan and should not be used in that way. The device is simply trying to take out the manual labour of putting food into a bowl. Another aspect of the device could be a sensor / button that the puppy can be trained to use when it is hungry, however this feature might not be implemented due to ethical reasons and whether it goes against the purpose of the product’s aim, to regulate the puppy’s diet. The competitors of this product mostly include stations that are pre set and not entirely programmable, my product would stand out from these devices because it would not be an entire unit, ie the bowl and food holder, it would be entirely portable and not as bulky. The price range of these product is usually set at $100 and my product would cost not even half of that as the materiels (raspberry pi, plastic scoops, DC motor and holding set) are not overly priced and designed to be sold at a retail level.

Skills required:
The ability to create some sort of code or modify it to make the timer, and motor command function is essential, as well as the ability to create a holder that would act as a chassis for the raspberry pi, motor, wires and food scoops. The ability to make the product as portable, and as neat as possible is preferred. Time management skills will also be required for making this device. Knowledge of the simple physics involved with the device is also required and consideration of the aim of the device is needed to be kept in mind.

Outcome:
The aim of the device is simply to remove the manual labour of putting pet food into a bowl every so often, so when the device is able to effectively perform that task, it would have been successful. It will need to be consistent in performing the task without major errors. If the device encounters design problems they can be fixed and the design can be altered as long as the original idea and aim is achieved, if programming and motor problems occur, there may need to be a revision of the systems in place to perform the aim.
